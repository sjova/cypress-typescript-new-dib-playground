## Giving feedback

- Ask questions rather than make demands/commands. Engage in conversation: "What do you think about ?", "Did you consider ... ?", "Can you clarify ... ?".
- Offer compliments in code lines when you learn something new or something is well done.
- Don't say "Why didn't you just ... ?", "just", "simply", "easily" don't give good feels. Please don't use them when asking questions.
- Be explicit. Remember, people don't always understand your intentions online.
